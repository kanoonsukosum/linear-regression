# Linear Regression Analysis with World Bank Data

## Description
This project leverages Python to implement linear regression on real-world data from The World Bank, focusing on Japan's unemployment rates and GDP. It uses libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib, pandas, SciPy, and scikit-learn to conduct the analysis, visualize results, and assess model accuracy with the R-squared metric. This endeavor bridges classroom concepts with practical data analysis, offering hands-on experience with Python and scientific computing frameworks.

## Dataset Source
Data for this analysis is sourced from The World Bank's country-specific datasets, available at [The World Bank - Country Data](https://data.worldbank.org/country). These datasets are under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0), which allows for adaptation and use in any manner, provided appropriate attribution is given.

## Installation
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. Clone this repository, then install the required libraries using pip: ``pip install numpy matplotlib pandas scipy scikit-learn``

## Usage
Run the script from your terminal or command prompt: ``python linear_regress.py``

The script will perform linear regression analysis on the dataset, outputting the regression coefficients, R-squared value, and generating plots to visualize the data and the regression line.
